Philosophy
=====================

From ancient times, I mean, *really* ancient, all the way before Plato, Aristotle and all, people have beein entertaining themselves with a fancy question: what's the world consist of? What is the reality surrounding us? What is there? What is it like? Why?

There are apples and oranges, and there is the apple in front of me. There are Tuesdays and sevens, and today is Tuesday and there are seven avocados in my refrigerator.
There is honesty and there are specific persons which are honest.

It seems that there are concrete objects, like that apple in front of me, and there are ways those objects are, like being red, being sweet and laying on the table.
Usually, properties take a predicate position in a sentence.
If I had two apples in front of me, and both of them were red, *what* makes them both red?
There must be something that explains the seemingly simple fact that many objects share the same property. What is this, that is shared, that ground the redness of many apples? Is it an object? Is it tangible?
There are at least two major views on that. The first one says that, yes, there is a special "thing" called Universal, and all the concrete objects have their properties in virtue of sharing specific Universals.
The second view is that two rednesses of two apples are distinct tangible entities called tropes, which represent the property of being red. What makes those entities similar?
It's either the fact of sharing a universal Red, or a mysterious entity representing this similarity relation -- trope again.
Both views has their supporters, arguing furiously for a good couple of thousand years. Both sides have good arguments for supported view and against opponents' view.
But this debate seems to be far from being resolved; I doubt it can be resolved ever. This problem even has a name: Problem of Universals.

Besides, there is a specific kind which seems to be *natural*, the one where all the apples belong: the kind called "apple". What makes it "natural"? It ubiquity, universality, and, uhm, naturalness.
Do all the green things form a natural kind of "Green thing"? Some say yes, some say otherwise. Again, both sides have good arguments.

Finally, there are intangible objects, like numbers or feelings. They are definitely out there, and they seem to be close to both properties and natural kinds.
For example, linguistics says that there are several ways to nominalize a predicate. For example, there is a brave person and there is bravery. It works the other way round as well: some abstract objects can be "unnominalized".
But we can't do that with Thursdays, and there is no straightforward accepted way to do that with numbers.

Up to this point, things might seem quite complicated. But the world's ontology is finite, and I've already outlined its main constituents.
For most of contemporary philosophers, the ontology is even more parsimonious.



1. Different things fall into the same category. Small green sour apple and big sweet red apple, both fall into the category of "apple".
2. When someone says "apple", how do I know what she means? Because I'm aware of the "apple" concept.
3. When someone looks at the apple, she *knows* that it's an apple. When someone says "apple", the other person knows what it means.
When someone looks at the painting with an apple, she knows that it's an apple either because it has some properties inherent to an apple. The sum of those properties form a holistic concept.
4. How should I represent concepts in code? I need to reduce the cognitive load when somebody reads the code. When she looks at any language lexeme, she must know *what* it means.
5. How to do that? We can borrow a metaphysical framework, the specific way that reality is carved into constituent pieces.



When we speak, we operate with some universal concepts we all understand. When I say "apple", I mean a cubic fruit, typically red or green or yellow, often sweet, sometimes a bit sour.
If you speak English, you easily understand what I say. You understand if someone else says "apple" either. Different instances of the "apple" word which mean different apples, they all fall down into the same "apple" concept, the "apple" category.
If you take a look at Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, you'll realize that it depicts some woman. You'll have no doubt whether it's a woman, or an apple or a giraffe.
You'll see two eyes, one nose, and one mouth, among the rest. Most of the people of the World have that stuff as part of their faces. So Mona Lisa represents a universal concept of a face,
so that pretty much anyone can spot it.



Lingustics: language is categorized. There are nouns, they typically take the subject position. There are verbs and adjectives; often they are predicates.




But before that, let me ask. What art style do you understand better, abstractionism or <вменяемый стиль>? Why? You don't have to guess what an artist meant by drawing some cube;
if he meant an apple, he draws an apple.
You don't need a translation layer, like, there is a cube, but actually, it's a giraffe.




Ok, so this is all good and fine, but how the hell it regards to programming?
