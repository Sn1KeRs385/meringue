Meringue documentation
===================================
`Meringue <https://github.com/wrong-about-everything/meringue>`_ is an object-oriented implementation of datetime functionality in php.
It's built atop the few fundamental universal abstractions, so it's minimalistic, intuitive and extendable.
At the same time, it allows carrying out complex datetime calculations because of its inherent declarative nature.
